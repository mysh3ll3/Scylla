Note: this is NOT the official branch! I just created a fork to keep track of personal modifications.

Compilation works without errors using Visual Studio 2010 Pro (Express does not include ATL by default) on Win 8/10, but there seem to be problems with IAT search. Maybe need to compile under Win7?
